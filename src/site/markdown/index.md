## What is Cesium+ pod ?

Cesium+ pod is [an ElastiSearch node](./ES.html), used to store (with full-text capabilities) all blockchain data, and additional user data. 

- It comes with a public [HTTP API](./ES_API.html) to store and retrieve all this data.
   
- The RESTfull API is used by [Cesium+](https://www.github.com/duniter/cesium) (a Duniter wallet).
     

The pod is divided in several ElasticSearch plugins: `core`, `user` and `subscription`.
